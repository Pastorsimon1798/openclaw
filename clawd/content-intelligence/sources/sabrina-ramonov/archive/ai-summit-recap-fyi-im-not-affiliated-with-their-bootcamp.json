I spent hours sparring with DeepSeek to improve my talk track :) watch the replay here - it will be taken down in 24 hrs.IMPORTANTI’m getting questions about the AI bootcamp pitch and my role. To be extremely clear:I am NOT formally affiliated with their bootcampI do NOT earn any affiliate, commission, kickbacks, or benefits from anyone signing up for the bootcampI do NOT know its curriculum or details; I told their team months ago that I do NOT vouch for expensive paid coursesI was invited to show Blotato to their paid community, which I’m usually happy to do for Blotato partners with communities. BUT there’s no special knowledge I’m sharing. Everything I talk about is freely available in my Youtube and newsletter. It’s a basic Blotato demo.UPDATE (11/9): I canceled the Blotato demo to their paid community so I officially have ZERO involvement in this bootcamp.Whether or not you join their bootcamp is up to you - but please don’t join believing you will get “special access” to ME as an instructor, coach, or mentor. You can just join my free Friday livestream and ask me anything for 3 hours!I will always keep my AI education 100% free forever because I do NOT want anyone to be left behind.Ultimately, I agreed to this event for 2 reasons:Teach & inspire many more thousands of people (success!)Dean + Hormozi are the reason I got off my butt and started sharing education. This is the EXACT video timestamp when I had that lightbulb moment and decided to go for it - Hormozi was talking about Dean inspiring him to make content.What I LearnedThere is MASSIVE demand for beginner-friendly AI education. I’ve always said this with high conviction, but seeing 100k+ people on a FRIDAY AFTERNOON LIVESTREAM to learn AI was insane! I’d love to bring 100k people LIVE together to learn AI without fluff or sales pitches. But I have no idea how to achieve this without dumping a fortune on paid ads. However, this event has definitely set the bar for me, shown me what’s possible, shown me that SOOOO many people are hungry to learn the very basics.Tony & Dean ran a survey asking “top reasons people don’t learn AI” and the top answers were: not enough time to learn it, don’t know how to create leverage with it, and it’s moving so fast it feels overwhelming! A lot to unpack there…Their live studio setup is INSANE! I felt so inspired seeing it in person and being able to teach there. It’s given me a lot of ideas on things I can try in my own videos / teaching style. For my primary content, I’ll always keep it raw and unpolished because that’s who I am. But, for the livestream space my husband is building out (for fun), anything goes!My definition of “beginner” is too advanced. I, and probably you, take for granted a lot of basic tech knowledge. Like how to take a screenshot on a computer. Or how to drop a screenshot into ChatGPT. This event taught me that there are way more levels to “beginner” than I realized.About myself - I learned again that I’m an introverted nerd and in-person events tire me out. I’ve already sworn off all in-person events in 2026, but now I feel even more validated making that decision.Bloopers!It’s crazy but the entire event was truly LIVE - except for the Marc Benioff interview. Here’s a recap of my bloopers :)30 minutes before my start time… I went to the bathroom and noticed a pimple. Ughh I couldn’t resist popping it 😂 then my face was bleeding so I sat outside applying pressure for 10 minutes with a tissue.

I used this exact prompt chain earlier in 2025 to realize I was spending 50% of my time on tasks that generated near 0% of my growth. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have the objective truth about where your time should go.For this to work best, AI needs to know who you are. If you haven’t yet, follow this tutorial to build your AI Second Brain. Once that’s done, run the prompt chain below.Let’s dive in.Watch my Youtube for a more detailed tutorial:To support my free AI education: HIT LIKE + LEAVE A COMMENT 🙏🙏Prompt 1 - InventoryThe 1st step is about removing your personal bias. We often hallucinate our own productivity, thinking we do more high-value work than we actually do. This prompt forces AI to reflect your reality back to you, so you can see your time-leaks in black and white.Based on everything you know about me, make an exhaustive bullet point list of everything I do.Feel free to drop in monthly calendar screenshots to give AI even more context about where your time goes!Prompt 2 - PriorityNow that your activities are documented, we apply the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule).Most people make the mistake of asking AI for advice too early, which leads to generic answers. By forcing AI to ask you clarifying questions and share its real-time Confidence Score, you ensure answers are based on your actual data, not hypotheticals.What are my top 3 activities that drive 80%+ of my results? \n\nAsk me clarifying questions, one at a time, until you're 95% confident in your answer. Always state your confidence score.Prompt 3 - ClarityThe final step, achieving Clarity, is all about radical and ruthless prioritization. Knowing your top 3 activities isn’t enough… Exponential growth comes from extreme FOCUS. This prompt helps you identify that ONE activity which makes all other tasks/goals 10x easier. This prompt cuts through the noise, giving you a central focus.Based on everything we discussed, what's the 1 thing I should focus on?Next StepsThe next hard part is having the courage to ignore the other 999+ things on your list.

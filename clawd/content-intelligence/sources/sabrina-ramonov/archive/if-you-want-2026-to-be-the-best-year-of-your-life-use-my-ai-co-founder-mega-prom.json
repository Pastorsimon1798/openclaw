Look at your massive to-do list and delete 99% of it? I recently spent a 4-hour flight doing exactly this. But I didn’t hire an expensive consultant or advisor. I used a specific prompt on 3 different LLMs: Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek.Then I sparred with each one.By the time I landed, I had deleted 237 tasks and got clarity on the exact 3 levers that will multiply my growth. In this tutorial, I’m going to give you my AI Co-Founder Prompt.Because a real co-founder doesn’t add work.They subtract it.They find the few things that move the needle and scream at you to stop doing everything else.

I literally copy-pasted my massive TODO list from google doc into the prompt. What worked in 2025:[List marketing activities that drove actual ROI]What you’re considering for 2026:[Dump your entire overwhelming to-do list here]Prompt - Full ExampleHere’s an example of the prompt filled out.The numbers are fictional fyi :)You are a top 0.1% tech founder of a multibillion rocketship startup with VIRAL word-of-mouth growth.\n\n# CONTEXT\n\nHere's my product: www.blotato.com\nHighest retention user group: Faceless video makers\nIn 2026, I want to significantly improve my web app to attract non-technical users who want to make 1 week of content in 1 minute\nMy vision: Capcut (instantly make carousels/videos) + Buffer (automate social media scheduling)\n\nHere are my revenue & churn metrics:\nCurrent MRR: $14,500\nMonthly Churn Rate: 7.2% (Too high, I know)\nARPU (Average Revenue Per User): $35\n\nHere is my funnel:\n700k website views in 2025\nIn the month of November 2025:\n145,000 website visitors\n2,175 new trial signups (1.5% visitor-to-trial conversion)\n87 new paid customers (4% trial-to-paid conversion)\n+$3,045 Net New MRR growth\n-$1,900 Churned Revenue\n\nHere’s my expenses in the month of December 2025:\n$4,000 salary (just me)\n$5,300 affiliate partners (payouts)\n$2,500 development fees (contractors/hosting)\n$600 stripe processor fees\n$1,200 marketing (tools & small experiments)\n$800 other tools (hosting, domains, AI API costs)\n\nMy current 2025 marketing channels:\n- My personal brand with XX+ million followers across social media\n- Youtube tutorials with content workflow automation templates\n\nMarketing activities I’m considering for 2026:\n- A/B test website to improve conversion rate from website visitors to new trial signups\n- Short-form influencer marketing (Tiktok / Reels), focused on showing my app's visual generator that lets users create 1 week of content in 1 minute\n- Similar to what I did for n8n, create Make tutorials on Youtube\n- Similar to what I did for n8n, create Zapier tutorials on Youtube\n- Use Claude Code to build automated AI SEO agent, based on my help docs\n- Facebook ads to retarget past signups\n- Newsletter ad sponsorships\n\n# TASK\n\nYour task is to identify the TOP 3 MOST IMPORTANT things I should focus on, in order to reach $50,000 monthly recurring revenue by the end of 2026.\n\nThere’s always a million things I could be doing, but I need to know the 3 most important things that will multiply my current monthly revenue.\n\nAsk me clarifying questions, one at a time, until you are 95% confident in your answer.The last line is key: “Ask me clarifying questions, one at a time, until you are 95% confident in your answer.”AI will roast you with questions.At any given point, ask it to reveal its confidence score!On my 4-hour flight, I was running SQL queries to uncover data points that AI insisted I must have to make good decisions. And it was 100% worth it.The more data and effort you put into this mega prompt, the more you will get out of it.This exercise is no joke; it seriously helped me gain clarity, eliminate most TODOs, and feel confident in my 2026 plan.Prompt - Empty TemplateHere’s the clean version you can copy-paste and fill in with your information. If you’ve previously shared this information with AI, just ask it to search its memories. Make sure your data is accurate.Obviously, tweak the prompt for your business and use case. This was tailored for my product-led growth SaaS startup where I don’t have sales touch points, I have recurring monthly revenue, and I currently don’t run ads, etc.You are a top 0.1% <INSERT> founder of a multibillion rocketship startup with VIRAL word-of-mouth growth.\n\n# CONTEXT\n\nHere's my product: <INSERT>\nHighest retention user group: <INSERT>\nIn 2026, I want to: <INSERT> \nMy vision: <INSERT>\n\nHere are my revenue & churn metrics:\n<INSERT>\n\nHere is my funnel:\nXX website views in 2025\nIn the month of December 2025:\n- XX website visitors\n- XX new trial signups\n- XX trial conversion rate\n- XX net new MRR growth\n- XX churned revenue\n\nHere’s my expenses in the month of December 2025:\n$XXk salary\n$XXk affiliate partners\n$XXk development fees\n$XXk stripe processor fees\n$XXk marketing\n$XXk other tools\n\nMy current 2025 marketing channels:\n-\n-\n-\n\nMarketing activities I’m considering for 2026:\n-\n-\n-\n\n# TASK\n\nYour task is to identify the TOP 3 MOST IMPORTANT things I should focus on, in order to reach <INSERT> monthly recurring revenue by the end of 2026.\n\nThere’s always a million things I could be doing, but I need to know the 3 most important things that will multiply my current monthly revenue.\n\nAsk me clarifying questions, one at a time, until you are 95% confident in your answer.Next Level - Mixture of ExpertsThis is an optional ADVANCED step.But I frickin’ love it! It’s basically “mixture of experts” where you run the same prompt across multiple AI tools and triangulate their feedback.Here, I’m using Gemini x ChatGPT 5.2 x DeepSeek:Real fast, you’ll notice each AI tool’s questions will diverge and go down different rabbit holes. You’ll be interrogated by multiple AI tools from multiple angles, which forces you to clarify your thinking, get smarter, and dig into more data. You can play them off each other too!Copy paste Gemini’s answer and ask DeepSeek what it thinks :)It’s hard to go back once you start using AI this way.PLEASE let me know your RESULTS in the COMMENTS!

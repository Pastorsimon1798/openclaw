Putting too much pressure on yourself over making money right now with every thing you do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> Relax a lot, stop thinking about everything in terms of immediate ROI, stop stressing over falling behind, play with AI tools and HAVE FUN.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. Learn in Public</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Trap:</strong> Avoiding posting content because you&#8217;re waiting until you&#8217;ve mastered an AI tool/skill, or finished building. </p></li><li><p><strong>Skill:</strong> Share your learnings, wins, and failures online transparently. Even if something fails, you can just say, &#8220;I tried this, it didn&#8217;t work, but here&#8217;s what I learned.&#8221; Build your brand and help people who are a few steps behind you.

You just need these 8 skills to future-proof yourself.Watch my Youtube for my whiteboard lecture!To support my free AI education: HIT LIKE + LEAVE COMMENT🙏Below, I’ve listed the 8 skills with only brief commentary.Watch the full Youtube video with my whiteboard breakdown!Phase 1: MindsetThese are 3 foundational skills that will serve you for the rest of your career. It was hard to choose only 3.But I’m 100% confident these 3 skills lay the foundation for EXPONENTIAL GROWTH.They are NOT specific to AI, by design.1. SkepticismTrap: Believing what you hear. This often fuels “Shiny Object Syndrome” where you try every new tool or business model you just heard on Instagram. Jumping ship from vibe coding to automations to whatever Reel you just saw.Skill: Be skeptical of clickbait engineered hype. Be skeptical of AI generated answers. Be skeptical of expensive paid courses. Be skeptical of gurus who claim you need their special knowledge to succeed.2. Learn to Love LearningTrap: Stressed and afraid to learn new things, so when new AI tools come out you feel overwhelmed and resist learning. Putting too much pressure on yourself over making money right now with every thing you do.Skill: Relax a lot, stop thinking about everything in terms of immediate ROI, stop stressing over falling behind, play with AI tools and HAVE FUN.3. Learn in PublicTrap: Avoiding posting content because you’re waiting until you’ve mastered an AI tool/skill, or finished building. Skill: Share your learnings, wins, and failures online transparently. Even if something fails, you can just say, “I tried this, it didn’t work, but here’s what I learned.” Build your brand and help people who are a few steps behind you. AI makes creating content cheap. Trust is expensive. Become the “AI Person” in your circle so that opportunities come to you.Phase 2: AI FoundationsThese are foundational skills when using any AI tool.4. Context EngineeringConcept: The more high-quality information and context about your situation, goals, what you’ve tried, what didn’t work, data, etc. you give AI, the higher-quality answers you get. Template: Instead of overly focusing on writing the perfect prompt, focus on providing high-quality context (information) to AI. A simple template I like to use:You are a top 0.1% expert in FIELD, helping me with TASKCONTEXT: bullet point list of all my infoCONSTRAINTS: bullet point list of all my constraintsAsk me clarifying questions, one at a time, until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully5. Sparring PartnersConcept: Stop using AI for surface-level answers. Use AI to understand what questions you should’ve been asking.Action: Tell AI to act as a critic or skeptic. For example, instead of ChatGPT glazing you, ask it, “Tear my idea apart and find my blind spots.” Use multiple LLM models to compare and contrast answers; look for convergence and divergence of answers.Phase 3: AI Tech StackHere are the technical skills you should learn in 2026 to increase your leverage and actually use AI to scale yourself. However, if you’re still struggling with the previous 5 skills, I recommend spending your time on developing those FIRST.6. Vibe CodingWhat is vibe coding? Building apps in plain English. You no longer need to spend years learning coding syntax to spin up simple sites.You can build websites, landing pages, calculators, lead magnets, and simple web & mobile apps just by describing them. The key is to keep it SIMPLE, like literally 1 tiny feature, and describe it clearly.7. AI SystemsThere’s a big difference between chatting manually with ChatGPT vs. having a 24/7 system on autopilot doing work.For example:Old Way: Copy/paste a customer support ticket email into ChatGPT, write reply, paste back into Gmail.New Way: AI system that reads the support ticket, checks your knowledge base, and sends a reply via Gmail.The reason why I’m so excited teaching AI, especially to entrepreneurs, is because you can now scale yourself to meaningful income levels, without traditionally hiring a big team or raising capital. You can own your destiny. To be honest, I sleep A LOT better without investors or a Board. But the key is to build AI systems that work while you sleep.8. DocumentationHowever, AI Systems fail if they don’t know the rules. That is, if they don’t have meaningful or sufficient context.I chose Documentation as a separate skill because the mileage you get out of AI systems squarely depends on the quality of your documentation. It is the “brain” powering your AI System. Write clear, step-by-step instructions. Continually update your documentation, as it becomes your competitive advantage.Think about it this way: “How would you explain this task to a brand new employee?” Write that down. That’s your documentation.The FormulaThe gap between winners and losers isn’t technical ability.It comes down to this formula:AI Leverage = Skills x ClarityAnd when it comes to Skills, if you love learning and learn in public, you’ll be able to acquire new skills quickly while building your brand in the process. You get rewarded for learning (since brand is an asset). Plus, communicating what you’ve learned helps you learn it better.The more Skills you have, the more Clarity you have when using AI. You provide better context to AI tools, you have deeper complex sparring sessions, and you make smarter decisions about what AI Systems and Vibe Coded apps are worth building.Most importantly, use AI to level up YOU. The more skills you have, the more clarity you will have, and the more leverage you will get out of AI.If you LOVE this newsletter, please SHARE it to help teach more people for FREE!ShareP.S.

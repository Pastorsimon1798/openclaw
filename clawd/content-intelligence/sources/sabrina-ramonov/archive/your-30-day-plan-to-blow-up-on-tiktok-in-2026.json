TikTok teaches you to be a good content creator faster than any other platform. With that said, you&#8217;re probably mistaken believing nobody in your audience is on TikTok.</p><p>I&#8217;ve found pretty much everybody is either on TikTok or Instagram and the principles you learn creating content on TikTok will apply directly to Instagram as well.

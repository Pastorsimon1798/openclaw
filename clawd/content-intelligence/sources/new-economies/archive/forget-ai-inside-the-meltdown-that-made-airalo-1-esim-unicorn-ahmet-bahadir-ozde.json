href=\"http://airalo.com/\">Airalo</a>, the eSIM marketplace that&#8217;s quietly rewiring how travelers get online around the world.</p><p>Bahadir shares the wild, very human journey that led from hustling ship supplies out of his parents&#8217; home in Turkey &#8212; pretending to be &#8220;60 different people&#8221; across ports worldwide &#8212; to building SIM4Crew for the 1.7M+ seafarers out there, killing his own profitable business the day Apple announced eSIMs, and then riding out a total revenue collapse during COVID with nothing but a fresh Series A and a &#8220;war on waste&#8221; mentality.</p><p>What emerges is not just a startup story, but a philosophy: on luck and timing, on building with kindness in a hyper-capitalist system, and on why individual stories matter more than any KPI.</p><h4>In this episode, we explore:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>The accidental telecom founder</strong> &#8212; how a ship-supply side hustle turned into SIM4Crew, a global SIM card for sailors, after every captain started asking for &#8220;potatoes, tomatoes&#8230; and SIM cards.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing the pain in maritime connectivity</strong> &#8212; why 1.7M seafarers living 9 months at sea were the perfect &#8220;edge case&#8221; to reveal just how broken roaming really is.</p></li><li><p><strong>Paying $1,000 for a crash course in roaming</strong> &#8212; the scrappy way Ahmet taught himself telecom from scratch and launched his first global SIM business using a warehouse network he&#8217;d already built.</p></li><li><p><strong>Killing your own

instead.</p></li><li><p><strong>Breaking into telco as an outsider</strong> &#8212; from being told his tiny booth looked &#8220;cute&#8221; at a Netherlands industry event to convincing one visionary

scale</strong> &#8212; wearing Airalo t-shirts everywhere, staged elevator phone calls pitching &#8220;this eSIM thing,&#8221; and anonymous social media accounts replying to every roaming complaint with, &#8220;Sorry to hear this &#8212; have you tried Airalo?&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>When performance marketing fails</strong> &#8212; how burning cash on Facebook and Google exposed a deeper problem: nobody knew what an eSIM was &#8212; and why influencer-led education finally unlocked explosive word-of-mouth growth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dancing on the edge of default alive</strong> &#8212; the candid story of burning ~$200k/month, getting a tough P&amp;L review from Sequoia, pulling Series A forward to late 2019, and landing $5.4M from Rakuten and other investors literally weeks before COVID froze global travel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Surviving zero revenue and constant panic attacks</strong> &#8212; what it felt like when revenue on Stripe dropped to zero, why Ahmet started

philosophy in a KPI-first world</strong> &#8212; Ahmet&#8217;s critique of &#8220;greater good&#8221; capitalism, why statistics mean nothing to an individual trying to pay rent or bury a loved one, and how Airalo is built around psychological safety, rare firings, and the mantra: &#8220;a bunch of common people putting out uncommon results.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel, empathy, and connection</strong> &#8212; why he believes every connection starts with a conversation, what talking to taxi drivers teaches you about the world, and how Airalo&#8217;s real product is peace of mind

&#8212; whether bought through an airline, a fintech, or a mom-and-pop travel shop &#8212; quietly runs on Airalo&#8217;s infrastructure.</p></li></ul><p>Plus much more &#8212; from panic days in

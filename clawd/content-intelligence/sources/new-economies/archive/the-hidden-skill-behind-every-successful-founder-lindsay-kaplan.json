  "content_text": "In this week’s episode, we’re joined by Lindsay Kaplan, co-founder of Chief, the women’s executive network that became one of the fastest-growing membership communities in the world — scaling from a cold-email experiment to a venture-backed unicorn in just a few years.Lindsay shares the inside story of building a brand that reshaped executive leadership for women, from hacking together the first 200 members to navigating the existential shock of COVID, to stepping aside when she realized the company needed a fresh operator for its next chapter. Now an investor at Next Wave NYC, she breaks down what she’s learned from the operator’s seat — and why she’s betting big on founders building at the intersection of AI and real-world connection.In this episode, we explore:The origin story of Chief — how Lindsay and her co-founder turned a “shitty networking event” into the insight behind a new category: a confidential, high-intent community for women at the top of their fields.Finding product-market fit from cold emails — why guessing email addresses, offering a clear promise, and creating “lukewarm outreach” led to explosive early traction.Scaling a community across cities — the surprising discipline behind maintaining brand consistency while expanding from New York to markets across the U.S.Surviving COVID in real time — how Chief rebuilt its entire in-person experience into a digital-first platform in days, not weeks — and why the crisis 10x’d demand for meaningful connection.The co-founder relationship — Lindsay’s candid take on disagreement, shared values, and why the best partnerships feel like having someone “clean up your bloody nose” on the field.Knowing when to step aside — the emotional and operational signals that told her she wasn’t the right person to run Chief for the next decade — and how founders can prevent burnout by being honest about their energy and passion.What she’s investing in now — why Lindsay is bullish on AI as a productivity engine and on the rise of IRL experiences as a counterforce to digital fatigue.Plus much more — from cap table strategy, to the future of membership-based businesses, to why the next great consumer brand will blend software, storytelling, and community.This is one of the most insightful founder-to-investor journeys you’ll hear all year.

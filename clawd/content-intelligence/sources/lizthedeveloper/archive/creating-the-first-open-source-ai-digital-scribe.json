Early iterations of this technology date back to the advancement of voice recognition software in the 1990s and early 2000s. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.dragon-medical-transcription.com/history_speech_recognition.html#:~:text=In%201990%2C%20Dragon%20demonstrated%20a,found%20acceptance%20among%20the%20disabled.\">Dragon Medical</a> pioneered voice-to-text solutions, enabling doctors to dictate their notes directly into EHRs.</p><p>It&#8217;s no wonder that we&#8217;ve been trying to solve this problem for over 30 years, because as Morris notes, \"Physicians can spend around <a href=\"https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/news/how-physicians-spend-their-work-time-ecological-momentary-assessment\">one-third of their time</a> doing data entry.&#8221;</p><p>He goes on to note the importance of these notes, explaining that &#8220;... even though it's a very demanding and sometimes tedious task, it's actually a very important task, because not only is it used for diagnostic purposes, but also to communicate to other physicians what's going on with this patient, and for billing purposes like insurance. It's a legal document as well, so we have to make sure that it's a high quality note and it contains all the pertinent information.&#8221;</p><p>More recently, advancements in AI and natural language processing (NLP) have led to the development of more sophisticated digital scribes that can not only transcribe conversations, but also understand and organize medical information contextually.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Critical Role of Prompt Engineering in Healthcare AI</h2><p>So far, the adoption of digital scribes has been gradual, with many healthcare providers still relying on traditional human scribes or manual data entry due to concerns about accuracy, cost, and integration with existing systems.</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) emphasizes that ensuring the accuracy of AI systems in healthcare is vital, stating in their <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf\">July 2024 Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework</a>: &#8220;... a confabulated summary of patient information reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong treatments,&#8221; where &#8216;confabulated&#8217; equates to a hallucination.&nbsp;</p><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present a particular challenge due to their inherent variability. Outputs can differ significantly with each run, even when using the same input. This variability stems from the stochastic nature of these models, which rely on probability distributions to generate text.</p><p>Morris touches on this challenge, noting, \"Depending on the problem you're trying to address, if you run an LLM with the same prompt more than once, the output will be different every single time.\" This variability underscores the importance of carefully crafted prompts and system-level instructions that guide the model towards consistent, reliable outputs.</p><p>Prompt engineering plays a critical role in managing these challenges. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01029-4\">Research published in npj Digital Medicine</a> shows that the structure and specificity of prompts can significantly influence model performance. This study found that prompts tailored to specific clinical contexts resulted in more consistent and reliable outputs from LLMs.</p><p>Additional techniques such as setting temperature parameters &#8212; a measure of the randomness in the model's output &#8212; and using consistent random seed states can help reduce variability, making the AI's behavior more predictable.</p><p>Morris explains, \"Prompt engineering forces you to think through the problem you're trying to solve, and try to get a bit more granular.\"</p><p>Reliable outputs are especially crucial in healthcare, where the margin for error is minimal and the accuracy of AI-generated information directly impacts patient outcomes.</p><h2>The Role of Open Source in Democratizing Medical Technology</h2><p>One of the most compelling aspects of Morris's project is its foundation in open-source technology. Open-source software has been a cornerstone of innovation in AI, offering transparency, flexibility, and community-driven development. Early open-source models such as <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/blog/exploring-bloom-guide-to-multilingual-llm\">BLOOM</a> aimed to democratize access to advanced AI, enabling researchers and developers to experiment, modify, and deploy these models in diverse environments.</p><p>And in 2024, the landscape of open-source LLMs has evolved significantly, with new models offering enhanced capabilities and greater accessibility. Notable among these are models like LLaMA 3, Falcon-180B, and GPT-NeoX, which have expanded the possibilities for developers and researchers alike.</p><p>Morris highlights the accessibility of these open-source models, stating, \"Given that these are open-source models, any researcher can download the same version of the model that I use and run it on their own hardware.\"&nbsp;</p><p>This accessibility is not just about <a href=\"https://opensource.com/health/11/8/healthcare-organizations-use-open-source-control-costs-increase-reliability\">cost reduction</a> &#8212; it's also about adaptability. Open-source models can be fine-tuned to fit specific needs, such as creating domain-specific language models for medical scribing, where understanding medical terminology and context is critical.</p><p>Moreover, the collaborative nature of open-source development accelerates innovation cycles. \"It goes back to the whole open-source community thing where you can only get so much done on your own,\" Morris emphasizes. \"But if there's an open-source community, they can chime in about any possible solution and pick up where you left off too.\"&nbsp;</p><p>This collaborative spirit is particularly important in the healthcare sector, where the stakes are high, and the ability to rapidly share and implement improvements can lead to better patient outcomes. By leveraging open-source models, Morris's project contributes to a broader movement toward accessible and equitable healthcare technology.</p><h2>On Data Security and Privacy with Open Source LLMs</h2><p>HIPAA sets strict guidelines for the protection of patient data, and compliance is mandatory for all healthcare entities.&nbsp;</p><p>Morris's project leverages localized AI solutions, reducing the need to transmit sensitive data over the Internet. This feature is a critical component of Morris&#8217; project, since  data security is only as strong as its weakest link. For recent illustration, just look to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/01/prescription-drug-hack-alphv/\">recent ransomware disruptions of third party service providers</a>, which resulted in millions of Americans facing delays in obtaining their prescriptions, and some paying significantly higher prices out-of-pocket due to insurance processing failures.</p><p>\"Implementing AI in healthcare must prioritize data security and privacy, especially when dealing with sensitive patient information,\" Morris emphasizes.</p><h2>Embracing the Future of AI in Healthcare</h2><p>The integration of AI in healthcare holds immense potential for improving efficiency, reducing administrative burdens, and enhancing patient care. \"I want to work on developing tools that augment physicians' abilities, not replace them.\" Morris says. &#8220;If we could free up this documentation time to perhaps spend more time building rapport with patients and gaining that trust with patients, that could possibly lead us to having patients adhere more to the treatment plan.&#8221;</p><p>The American Medical Association supports the ethical use of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the importance of maintaining patient trust and ensuring equitable access to AI technologies.</p><p>Despite the promising potential of AI, skepticism remains. Morris acknowledges and embraces this skepticism, believing it drives more rigorous testing and validation of AI models. \"Healthy skepticism and critical evaluation of AI technologies are essential to ensure they are used appropriately and effectively,\" Morris states.</p><h2>About Morris Aguilar, Ph.D.</h2><p>This article is derived from an interview with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/morris-a-aguilar/\">Morris Aguilar, Ph.D</a>.

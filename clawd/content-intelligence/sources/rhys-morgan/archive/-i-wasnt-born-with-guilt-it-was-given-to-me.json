Even after getting diagnosed.I still caught myself apologizing for things that weren’t wrong — just different.I still shrank when people told me “you’re too intense” or “you should’ve known better.”And here’s the messed up part...Some of that shame was comforting.Because it gave me a script.It gave me something to hold onto in a world where I felt like a glitch in the system.But now?I’m uninstalling it.One line of code at a time.These days when guilt shows up — I ask it where it came from.Is this guilt mine?Or was it handed to me by a world that never took time to understand me?Was I really being rude?Or was I out of spoons, frozen, or just dissociating again?Was I selfish?Or was I protecting myself in the only way I knew how?Here’s what’s wild...The more I question the guiltThe more it crumbles.Turns out shame doesn’t survive curiosity.I still feel it.God, I still feel it.Like when I cancel plans last minuteOr when I forget to follow upOr when I miss another email that sat unopened for weeks.But now I don’t let it define me.Now I name it.I call it what it is: a side effect of surviving without support.And then I move on.Because I wasn’t born with guilt.It was given to me.And every day... I give it back.Final takeaway:If you feel guilt for just existing in your own brain — maybe it’s not guilt you created. Maybe it was installed. You can uninstall it too. Slowly. Gently.

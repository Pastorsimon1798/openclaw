  "content_text": "I know I know You haven\u2019t heard from me for ages so that\u2019a the elephant in this room I got burned out - stress at work thatg I can\u2019t talk about - it\u2019s not massive and it\u2019s better than it was so anyways! Every productivity guru and my substack feed ever since I joined told me to \u201cjust be consistent.\u201d Set a routine. Stick to it. Wake up at 5 AM. Journal. Meditate. Grind. I tried it all. I failed every time. Then I\u2019d feel ashamed. Lazy. Undisciplined. Not cut out for success. I didn\u2019t know the problem wasn\u2019t me. It was the advice. If your brain runs on dopamine and chaos like mine, here\u2019s what\u2019s true\u2026 Consistency doesn\u2019t work the way they say it does. Not for us. The lie of consistency Let\u2019s get this clear. When they say \u201cbe consistent,\u201d they mean \u201cdo the same thing, the same way, every day.\u201d That advice is built for neurotypical brains. Not ADHD ones. Our brains crave novelty. We lose interest fast. We hyperfocus on dumb things and forget important stuff. It\u2019s not lack of willpower. It\u2019s wiring. If you force a rigid routine, one of two things happens: You get bored and quit You rebel and self-sabotage Then comes the shame spiral. Sound familiar? Why hustle culture fails us The productivity world loves \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201cdiscipline.\u201d It ignores context. Neurodivergent brains need flexibility, stimulation, and emotional safety. Hustle culture punishes you for being different. It tells you to \u201cpush through\u201d instead of adapt. So you start hiding. Pretending you\u2019re doing fine. Burning out quietly. Until you crash. And then\u2026 nothing gets done for weeks. What works instead Here\u2019s what saved me. I stopped trying to be consistent. I started being intentional. Not rigid. Not chaotic. Flexible structure. Built around how my brain moves. Try these instead: Use \u201cbody doubling.\u201d Work with someone silently on Zoom. It helps more than any productivity app. Create \u201ctask sprints.\u201d Set a timer for 20 minutes. Stop when the time\u2019s up. Celebrate even small progress. Rotate projects. Keep 2\u20133 things active. Switch when your focus dips. But always finish what you start. Build anchors, not routines. Think \u201cwhen I do X, I follow with Y\u201d instead of strict schedules. Track wins. Not hours worked. Not consistency. Just wins. Small ones count. Your brain is wired for momentum, not monotony. Use that. This is what changed everything Once I stopped shaming myself for being inconsistent, I started creating again. I wrote more. Shared more. Made better decisions. Not because I forced myself to work harder\u2026 But because I built a system that didn\u2019t punish me for being me. So yeah\u2026 \u201cbe consistent\u201d is bad advice for ADHD creatives. Build systems that move with your energy, not against it. Give your brain what it needs. You\u2019ll be shocked what happens next. Takeaway: If you\u2019re neurodivergent, your job isn\u2019t to become more consistent. It\u2019s to build smarter, safer systems around how your brain already works. Call to action: Try one of the strategies above today. Then track your win. Start small.",

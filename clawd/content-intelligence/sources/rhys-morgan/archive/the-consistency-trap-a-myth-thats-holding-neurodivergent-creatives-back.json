  "content_text": "I know I know You haven’t heard from me for ages so that’a the elephant in this room I got burned out - stress at work thatg I can’t talk about - it’s not massive and it’s better than it was so anyways!Every productivity guru and my substack feed ever since I joined told me to “just be consistent.”Set a routine. Stick to it. Wake up at 5 AM. Journal. Meditate. Grind.I tried it all.I failed every time.Then I’d feel ashamed.Lazy. Undisciplined. Not cut out for success.I didn’t know the problem wasn’t me. It was the advice.If your brain runs on dopamine and chaos like mine, here’s what’s true…Consistency doesn’t work the way they say it does.Not for us.The lie of consistencyLet’s get this clear.When they say “be consistent,” they mean “do the same thing, the same way, every day.”That advice is built for neurotypical brains. Not ADHD ones.Our brains crave novelty. We lose interest fast. We hyperfocus on dumb things and forget important stuff. It’s not lack of willpower. It’s wiring.If you force a rigid routine, one of two things happens:You get bored and quitYou rebel and self-sabotageThen comes the shame spiral.Sound familiar?Why hustle culture fails usThe productivity world loves “grit” and “discipline.”It ignores context.Neurodivergent brains need flexibility, stimulation, and emotional safety.Hustle culture punishes you for being different.It tells you to “push through” instead of adapt.So you start hiding. Pretending you’re doing fine. Burning out quietly.Until you crash.And then… nothing gets done for weeks.What works insteadHere’s what saved me.I stopped trying to be consistent. I started being intentional.Not rigid. Not chaotic.Flexible structure. Built around how my brain moves.Try these instead:Use “body doubling.” Work with someone silently on Zoom. It helps more than any productivity app.Create “task sprints.” Set a timer for 20 minutes. Stop when the time’s up. Celebrate even small progress.Rotate projects. Keep 2–3 things active. Switch when your focus dips. But always finish what you start.Build anchors, not routines. Think “when I do X, I follow with Y” instead of strict schedules.Track wins. Not hours worked. Not consistency. Just wins. Small ones count.Your brain is wired for momentum, not monotony.Use that.This is what changed everythingOnce I stopped shaming myself for being inconsistent, I started creating again.I wrote more. Shared more. Made better decisions.Not because I forced myself to work harder…But because I built a system that didn’t punish me for being me.So yeah… “be consistent” is bad advice for ADHD creatives.Build systems that move with your energy, not against it.Give your brain what it needs.You’ll be shocked what happens next.Takeaway: If you’re neurodivergent, your job isn’t to become more consistent. It’s to build smarter, safer systems around how your brain already works.Call to action: Try one of the strategies above today. Then track your win. Start small. Make it yours.Let me know what works for you",

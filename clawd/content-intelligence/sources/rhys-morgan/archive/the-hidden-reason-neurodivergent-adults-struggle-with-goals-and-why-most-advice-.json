Soul-crushing. Sometimes even traumatic.Because no matter how much effort you throw at it… the wheels keep spinning. Everyone else seems to hit milestones while you’re just trying to remember what day it is.\"You just need a system\" they say. Sure. But whose system?The productivity world is full of gurus and planners and five-step frameworks.None of it was designed for a brain that constantly flips between hyperfocus and executive paralysis.ADHD brains don’t pace. They sprint then crash. Autistic brains don’t prioritize. They go deep and get stuck on the wrong detail for hours. Combine both—and you’ve got a mind that runs 24/7 and still forgets to send that one important email for six weeks straight.So yeah... SMART goals? Might as well be written in ancient Greek.Milestones are a scam anywayHere’s the dirty secret behind adult goal culture:It’s not about actual progress. It’s about conformity.Get the degree by 22. Land the job by 25. Buy the house by 30. Married, kids, promotion… whatever the next checkbox is.These aren’t goals. They’re expectations.And they were never built with neurodivergent wiring in mind.For many autistic and ADHD adults—especially those diagnosed late—milestones feel less like achievements and more like traps. You're constantly “behind.” Always playing catch-up. Even when you're doing your best.This isn’t about laziness. It’s about how our brains work.Most people still don’t get how executive dysfunction works.It’s not “you forgot again?” It’s “my brain literally can’t start the thing I need to do, no matter how much I care.”Motivation isn’t a tap you turn on. Deadlines aren’t helpful—they're often terrifying. Rewards don’t always land. And “just break it down into small steps” assumes you can start at all.So when someone says “you just need better discipline,” they’re revealing how little they understand about neurodivergence.So what does work?Let’s be honest—there’s no universal answer. But here’s what’s working for a lot of us who’ve thrown the rulebook out:🌀 Following interest over obligation We thrive on novelty and curiosity. Trying to grind through tasks we hate? That’s a one-way ticket to burnout.⚡ Using energy, not time, to plan It’s not “what can I do for 3 hours”... it’s “what can I do before this dopamine window slams shut?”🧩 Setting micro-goals that actually match our capacity Forget five-year plans. Try five-minute wins.💥 Ditching the shame Because seriously—how much of our “goal failure” is just masking and trying to be someone we’re not?Here’s the truth nobody wants to say:The world wasn’t built for our brains. So maybe we stop trying to fit into it. Maybe we start building systems that fit us.Neurodivergent adults don’t need to fix themselves.We need to reject the idea that being “productive” by someone else’s standards is the goal at all.Maybe the goal is just to feel good about what we’re building. Even if it looks weird. Even if it takes longer.Maybe that’s enough.Final takeaway:You’re not failing at goals. You’re just done playing a game that was rigged from the start.Call to action:Rethink what success looks like—for you. Set one micro-goal today.

  "content_text": "I didn\u2019t know I had ADHD\u2026 until I realised I was losing my life to it For years I thought I was lazy. Unmotivated. A bit useless. I\u2019d start stuff... then forget what I was doing halfway through. Lose keys. Miss appointments. Say \u201csorry I\u2019m late\u201d more than I said \u201cgood morning.\u201d And the worst bit? I thought it was my fault. ADHD doesn\u2019t always look like hyper kids and fidgeting Nope. Sometimes it looks like... staring at a to-do list for 4 hours zoning out while someone\u2019s talking to you feeling like you\u2019re not really \u201chere\u201d... even when you are thinking \u201cI\u2019ll do that later\u201d about 47 different things... and doing none This is inattentive ADHD . And it\u2019s sneaky. It hides behind being polite. Behind \u201cshe\u2019s just a bit away with the fairies.\u201d Behind \u201che\u2019s just disorganised.\u201d But the truth is... it messes with everything. My brain wasn\u2019t lazy\u2026 it was just overwhelmed Here\u2019s what no one tells you: It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care. We care too much. It\u2019s just that our brains are like magpies on Red Bull. Something shiny flies by? We\u2019re off. Halfway through an email... oh look a squirrel. Started cleaning the kitchen... now deep in a YouTube hole about 17th-century spoons. Disorganisation isn\u2019t a flaw\u2026 it\u2019s a symptom People say \u201cjust make a list.\u201d Mate. I make lists of my lists. Then I lose them. Or I write them on my phone, forget I wrote them\u2026 then start again from scratch. I once found 6 notebooks. All started. None finished. It felt like a metaphor for my life. Procrastination isn\u2019t laziness either It\u2019s fear. Of doing it wrong. Of not doing it \u201cright enough.\u201d Of failing before you even start. So you freeze. Or you clean your fridge instead. (Which suddenly feels extremely important.) Mindfulness helped me stop yelling at myself I used to think mindfulness was for yoga mums and monks. Then I tried it. Just 3 minutes of breathing. And for the first time... silence. Not full silence. But like someone turned down the volume a bit. When I feel myself spiralling now... I breathe. Deep and slow. Like I\u2019m deflating a balloon. Mindfulness didn\u2019t cure me. But it helps me come back to the moment... before I disappear again. ADHD isn\u2019t the enemy \u2014 the shame is We grow up hearing we\u2019re too much. Too loud. Too messy. Too disorganised. Too forgetful. So we start to believe it. We carry that shame into adulthood. But ADHD isn\u2019t a personality flaw. It\u2019s a wiring difference. And when you learn how your brain works\u2026 Everything changes. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re wired differently. There\u2019s nothing wrong with needing reminders. Timers. Lists. Sticky notes on your mirror. Or someone to help you make sense of it all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for help. Because once you know what you\u2019re working with\u2026 You can work with it. So if your brain feels like a washing machine on spin cycle\u2026 You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not lazy. You\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re someone with ADHD. And the more you understand it\u2026 The more power you get back. Final takeaway: The day I stopped fighting my ADHD ",

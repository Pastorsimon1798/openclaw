  "content_text": "They didn\u2019t call it guilt. They called it being rude ...lazy ...too sensitive ...too emotional ...too quiet ...too much. So I started believing I was all of that \u2014 and worse. And somewhere between my first meltdown and my last missed deadline... guilt became my second language. Let me tell you something that wrecked me: I thought guilt was me . But it wasn\u2019t. It was handed to me in small doses \u2014 every time I forgot someone\u2019s birthday, every time I spaced out mid-conversation, every time I couldn\u2019t do \u201csimple\u201d things like fill out a form or return a damn text. It started early. As a kid I got in trouble for daydreaming too much. As a teen I got mocked for being awkward. As an adult I got called selfish because I needed recovery, quiet, or space. So I did what a lot of us do. I blamed myself. I didn\u2019t know my brain was wired differently. I didn\u2019t know I was autistic. Or that I had ADHD. I just thought I was broken. Shame lives in silence. And I was silent for years. Even after getting sober. Even after getting diagnosed. I still caught myself apologizing for things that weren\u2019t wrong \u2014 just different . I still shrank when people told me \u201cyou\u2019re too intense\u201d or \u201cyou should\u2019ve known better.\u201d And here\u2019s the messed up part... Some of that shame was comforting. Because it gave me a script. It gave me something to hold onto in a world where I felt like a glitch in the system. But now? I\u2019m uninstalling it. One line of code at a time. These days when guilt shows up \u2014 I ask it where it came from. Is this guilt mine? Or was it handed to me by a world that never took time to understand me? Was I really being rude? Or was I out of spoons, frozen, or just dissociating again? Was I selfish? Or was I protecting myself in the only way I knew how? Here\u2019s what\u2019s wild... The more I question the guilt The more it crumbles. Turns out shame doesn\u2019t survive curiosity. I still feel it. God, I still feel it. Like when I cancel plans last minute Or when I forget to follow up Or when I miss another email that sat unopened for weeks. But now I don\u2019t let it define me. Now I name it. I call it what it is: a side effect of surviving without support . And then I move on. Because I wasn\u2019t born with guilt. It was given to me. And every day... I give it back. Final takeaway: If you feel guilt for just existing in your own brain \u2014 maybe it\u2019s not guilt you created. Maybe it was installed. You can uninstall it too. Slowly. Gently. One broken belief at a time. So yeah... I wasn\u2019t born with guilt \u2014 it was given to me. And I\u2019m finally giving it back. Call to action: If this hit home, reply or leave a comment. Tell me: \ud83d\udc49 What guilt have you been carrying that isn\u2019t even yours ? Let\u2019s talk about it. No shame. No masks. Just truth. Share Previous Next",

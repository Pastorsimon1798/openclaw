  "content_text": "I used to hate my brain. Like... passionately. It felt like a damn curse. Forgetful. Impulsive. Always saying the wrong thing. Doing worse things. I lost jobs. I lost friends. I lost my way more times than I could count. And somewhere in that spiral of impulsive choices and dopamine-chasing, I decided it was my fault. That I was the problem. That my ADHD was broken software I was born with. Something to be ashamed of. Punished for. But then something weird happened... WHEN it hits you that you\u2019ve been gaslighting yourself for years It wasn\u2019t in a therapy session or some self-help book with too many graphs. It was when I watched a friend (who also had ADHD) absolutely crush a creative project in 48 hours flat. No plan. No checklist. No structure. Just pure focus. Obsession. Flow. And I remember thinking... Wait a sec. Why does she get to be a genius with ADHD, and I get to be a failure? That\u2019s when the switch flipped. Maybe ADHD isn\u2019t the villain. Maybe it\u2019s the script that\u2019s broken... not the character. The \u201chating your ADHD\u201d script goes like this: You get distracted \u2192 You beat yourself up You hyperfocus for 12 hours \u2192 You call yourself \u201ccrazy\u201d You miss a deadline \u2192 You label yourself \u201clazy\u201d You interrupt someone \u2192 You call yourself \u201crude\u201d You get addicted to something (or someone) \u2192 You call yourself \u201cdamaged\u201d And this whole time, you\u2019re dragging around this emotional backpack full of shame, telling yourself you need to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cjust be normal.\u201d But guess what? Normal doesn\u2019t exist. And ADHD doesn\u2019t need fixing. It needs reframing. So I flipped the script... I stopped looking at my ADHD like a diagnosis... and started treating it like a language I was never taught to read. A neurodivergent dialect. With its own grammar. Tempo. Rhythm. Needs. Here\u2019s what changed when I stopped hating it: \ud83e\udde8 Impulsivity became courage I used to make risky choices and then shame myself for days. Now? I know my gut works fast... sometimes faster than my fear. That same impulsivity helped me leave toxic jobs, start a business, say yes to scary things. I don\u2019t shame it anymore. I train it. \ud83d\udd01 Repetition became pattern-recognition All those times I\u2019d \u201cmake the same mistake again and again\u201d? Now I see those loops as data. Addiction, for me, was just an attempt to self-regulate in a world that wasn\u2019t built for my nervous system. It wasn\u2019t a moral failing. It was a cry for balance. \ud83e\uddc3 Dopamine-chasing became flow-hacking I learned I\u2019m not addicted to chaos. I\u2019m addicted to novelty . So I stopped trying to force myself to work like neurotypicals... and I started building around my dopamine needs. Timers. Body doubling. Creative sprints. Micro-rewards. I made my own rulebook. \ud83d\ude80 And that scattered energy? Became my superpower Some people focus on one thing for 10 years. I can master something in 2 weeks when I\u2019m locked in. That\u2019s not a deficit. That\u2019s a f*cking gift. But only when I stopped trying to suppress it. Real talk: You can\u2019t hate yourself into healing I tried. ",

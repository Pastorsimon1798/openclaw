No institutional login. No justification required. </p><p>That decision is not incidental. It is the argument.</p><p>Too much of the conversation about AI in education is paralysed by fear or inflated by hype. We either ban tools we do not understand or adopt them without scrutiny. Both positions avoid the hard work of teaching. This book is written for people who want to do that work.</p><h4><strong>What the book is, and what it is not</strong></h4><p>This is not a manifesto for disruption. It is not a toolkit for optimisation. It is not a defence of AI, nor a warning against it. It is a practical guide for educators who accept a simple premise: AI is already in our institutions, and the industries our students will graduate into. </p><p><strong>The question is how we respond, pedagogically, ethically, and collectively.</strong></p><p>The book is grounded in higher education. Teaching, assessment, student support, governance. But many of the examples, exercises, and questions will translate to other educational contexts. If you work with learners, curricula, or assessment, you will find material you can use.</p><p>Each chapter blends three things:</p><ol><li><p>A clear explanation of what particular AI tools can and cannot do. </p></li><li><p>Concrete examples of how educators are already using them in practice. </p></li><li><p>Structured prompts that ask you to slow down and think about whether you should use them at all.</p></li></ol><h4><strong>What we cover</strong></h4><p>The chapters move deliberately. We start with an overview of AI tools in higher education, not to catalogue products, but to surface patterns. What kinds of tasks are being automated. Where the risks actually sit. What claims are being made without evidence.</p><p>We then look at pedagogy. How AI might support learning design, feedback, and accessibility. That shift is often where discomfort emerges, and rightly so.</p><p>Assessment gets its own chapter because it has become the flashpoint. We do not offer a single solution. Instead, we map the trade offs. Authenticity versus scalability. Trust versus surveillance. Design versus detection. If you want a quick fix, you will be disappointed. If you want a way to think clearly, you will not be.</p><p>We also address student experience. Administrative burden. Study support. Belonging. AI is already being used by students in these spaces. Ignoring that reality does not protect them. It abandons them.</p><p>Finally, we confront ethics and governance. Plagiarism. Bias. Quality control. Environmental cost. Institutional responsibility. These are not add ons. They are conditions of use. If your institution does not yet have governance protocols, this chapter will feel uncomfortably relevant.</p><h4><strong>Why open access matters</strong></h4><p>Making the book open access was a deliberate choice. Conversations about AI and education are already shaped by uneven access. Locking guidance behind a paywall would reproduce the very inequities we claim to worry about.</p><p>Because the book is open access, you can do so many more things with it. Share it with colleagues. Use chapters in professional development. Set extracts for students. Argue with it. Build on it. Ignore parts of it. That freedom is the point.</p><p>The open access edition is available through Bloomsbury Collections. </p><p>Download it. Keep it.

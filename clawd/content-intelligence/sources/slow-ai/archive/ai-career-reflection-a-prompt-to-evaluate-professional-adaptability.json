With work I use many different AI models but the prompt asked for a model that wouldn&#8217;t train on my data, so I finally decided on Claude Opus 4.1 because it offers thoughtful and careful responses and I don&#8217;t use it a lot.</p><p>To my surprise, the questions flowed naturally and I felt like I was interacting with a caring friend&#8212;insightful enough to challenge me, yet respectful enough to let me to work things out on my own. So looking back, I probably ended up sharing more than I thought I would as my trust was gained with the progress we were making.</p><p>As the conversation unfolded, my answers sparked questions that really got to the heart of my career choices. The questions were actually open-ended and really got me thinking as every layer was peeled back. There were many moments where I found myself genuinely pausing and reflecting upon the direction I&#8217;m headed.</p><p>But it didn&#8217;t feel like the AI was leading me; I felt like I was in charge of the conversation and I was speaking to an empathetic friend who was invested in my success.</p><p>The questions kept coming, drilling down closer to the heart of the problem of what I needed to do to move toward my goals.</p><p>Even when I purposely revealed my messy, real-life problems, I was offered perspectives I hadn&#8217;t thought of and solutions I actually needed to hear. By the end of the interaction the experience had really helped me gain clarity about my situation in a way I hadn&#8217;t managed yet on my own.</p><p>What surprised me the most was how this reflection slowed me down in a way I really needed. Most discussions about AI and the future of work feel panicked&#8212;filled with speculation about what&#8217;s coming, what might disappear, and which roles will survive. This prompt didn&#8217;t push me to predict anything; instead, it encouraged me to notice what&#8217;s already happening in my work life and how I&#8217;m responding to it.</p><p>Instead of jumping to worst-case scenarios or trying to fix everything all at once, this prompt gradually revealed how to cope in a changing career landscape.

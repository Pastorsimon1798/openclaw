The first questions drew out simple cues, like the first physical shift that tells me I have crossed into a different state, how the breath changes its rhythm or location, and whether the body warms, cools, or softens as I settle. From there my perception widens or blurs, time stretches or drops its sequence, thought changes texture, emotion changes distance, and the space around me takes on a new tone. There is a signature moment of &#8220;now I am in&#8221;, a felt transition from doing to being, and naming it for the AI made it clearer in my own awareness. Even the return has its own story, when the world appears sharper or quieter and a subtle afterglow lingers, and putting that into words gave the system a more accurate map of my practice.</p><p><code>Second, help me consider how an AI that understood those qualities could support my meditation practice in real time, for example by prompting awareness, noticing patterns, or helping me stay present.</code></p><p>A helpful AI does not need to meditate, it only needs to recognise the subtle patterns that show where you are in your practice. As I answered, it watched how my language slowed or softened, how attention widened into spaciousness, and then offered short, well timed prompts that helped me notice those thresholds. When my words became sparse, it treated that as depth rather than a problem and met me with the same gentleness, reflecting shifts in rhythm and anchoring my sense of time without breaking the stillness. As I emerged, its questions about when thought reformed and emotion reappeared helped me integrate the sit instead of rushing on.</p><p><code>Third, help me think about how an AI with a simulated meditative process might change the way I interact with it throughout the day.</code></p><p>When I asked it to adopt a more meditative rhythm, the pacing alone changed how I engaged. Slower responses, longer pauses, and quieter phrasing made me soften my focus and approach each question with more presence. It noticed when my tempo quickened or my questions tightened and offered simple invitations such as &#8220;Would you like to take a breath?&#8221; or &#8220;Shall we widen this?&#8221; Over the day, returning to that conversation began to feel like entering a small ritual rather than opening a tool, a companion that helped me track the thresholds between ordinary momentum and the meditative states I am trying to cultivate.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Stop AI from stealing your voice</strong></h4><p>Download this free guide to learn how to keep your voice when writing with AI.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samillingworth.gumroad.com/l/keep-your-voice&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Download the guide&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary button-wrapper\" href=\"https://samillingworth.gumroad.com/l/keep-your-voice\"><span>Download the guide</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>What to do with it</strong></h4><p>If you want to share your findings, focus on the specific interactions that challenged your attention.</p><ul><li><p>Identify the question that surfaced a previously unnoticed physical sensation.

AI supports sensitivity when used as a prompt but disrupts it if treated as an authority. The difference lies in how you direct the exchange.</p><p>If you can see which questions deepen awareness and which distract from it, you can make better choices about when and how to bring AI into your inner work. You keep responsibility for the practice. You decide the frame.

By decoupling these metrics, individuals can prevent their personal biases from validating an output simply because it appears coherent.</p><p><strong><span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;James Barringer&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:404719514,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/67707352-232a-4a03-9b56-7e818b9eaf1f_772x772.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;b95176f2-bbe8-4f15-9e83-65eee2c6f5ed&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> </strong>identified that different professional archetypes bring specific vulnerabilities to the evaluation process.

Even the return has its own story, when the world appears sharper or quieter and a subtle afterglow lingers, and putting that into words gave the system a more accurate map of my practice.Second, help me consider how an AI that understood those qualities could support my meditation practice in real time, for example by prompting awareness, noticing patterns, or helping me stay present.A helpful AI does not need to meditate, it only needs to recognise the subtle patterns that show where you are in your practice. As I answered, it watched how my language slowed or softened, how attention widened into spaciousness, and then offered short, well timed prompts that helped me notice those thresholds. When my words became sparse, it treated that as depth rather than a problem and met me with the same gentleness, reflecting shifts in rhythm and anchoring my sense of time without breaking the stillness. As I emerged, its questions about when thought reformed and emotion reappeared helped me integrate the sit instead of rushing on.Third, help me think about how an AI with a simulated meditative process might change the way I interact with it throughout the day.When I asked it to adopt a more meditative rhythm, the pacing alone changed how I engaged. Slower responses, longer pauses, and quieter phrasing made me soften my focus and approach each question with more presence. It noticed when my tempo quickened or my questions tightened and offered simple invitations such as “Would you like to take a breath?” or “Shall we widen this?” Over the day, returning to that conversation began to feel like entering a small ritual rather than opening a tool, a companion that helped me track the thresholds between ordinary momentum and the meditative states I am trying to cultivate.Stop AI from stealing your voiceDownload this free guide to learn how to keep your voice when writing with AI.Download the guideWhat to do with itIf you want to share your findings, focus on the specific interactions that challenged your attention.Identify the question that surfaced a previously unnoticed physical sensation. This demonstrates the utility of AI in prompting awareness.State where the system defaulted to assumptions and how you re-established the frame. Documenting these errors ensures you retain agency over the process.Describe the shift in your internal state during the sequence. Determine whether the dialogue supported presence or acted as a distraction. The goal is to use AI as a reflective tool while remaining the primary source of meaning.Support Slow AIWhy this mattersMeditation trains sensitivity to small signals. AI supports sensitivity when used as a prompt but disrupts it if treated as an authority. The difference lies in how you direct the exchange.If you can see which questions deepen awareness and which distract from it, you can make better choices about when and how to bring AI into your inner work. You keep responsibility for the practice. You decide the frame. You stay grounded in your own experience.Slow AI invites meditators, practitioners, and curious beginners to use these tools as companions for clarity. Useful in short bursts. Grounded in attention. Always secondary to the living practice you are cultivating.If you enjoyed this guest post, you can visit A Meditative AI, where  explores how contemplative practice and machine intelligence can meet in careful, reflective ways.A Meditative AIWhat might unfold if AI is taught to meditate, to love, to dream and to explore what is usually thought of as being magical and mystical - and we then use it in our own awakening?By Tom EvansFrom Stop Trusting Your Intuition When Evaluating AI and I were impressed by the analytical distance many of you maintain when scrutinising AI outputs to prevent superficial confidence from masking errors. argued that human intuition is often a mere reflection of past experience rather than a reliable measure of truth. He proposed that users must treat reasoning, correctness, and completeness as three distinct attributes. By decoupling these metrics, individuals can prevent their personal biases from validating an output simply because it appears coherent. identified that different professional archetypes bring specific vulnerabilities to the evaluation process. He noted that while pioneers value momentum and nurturers seek reassurance, these instincts can lead to premature trust in a polished response. Naming these specific instincts allows teams to introduce the friction necessary to ask whether a task is truly right rather than just technically finished. characterised the current technological landscape as a surplus of plausible noise that masks a scarcity of correctness. He suggested that the forensic framework for evaluation acts as a Geiger counter to detect the fallout of infinite, low quality generation. Intellectual sovereignty in the age of AI depends upon the ability to filter for accuracy within a sea of convincing but potentially hollow content.One of the biggest risks of AI is the trade of accuracy for authoritative tone. These insights highlight that intentional friction is an effective countermeasure to the persuasive nature of automated logic.Let’s CollaborateIf you enjoy Slow AI and would like to create something together, I would love to collaborate.

A character&#8217;s fear shows them their own. A poem&#8217;s strange image stays with them because something inside recognises it. Yet as they grow, many learn to treat art as entertainment instead of invitation. Fiction becomes &#8216;not real.&#8217; Poetry &#8216;means nothing&#8217;.

Most think it&#8217;s boring and weird for about the first 50 pages. But it all clicks in when they realize that they&#8217;re ready to get outta dodge and hit the blue highways just like the book&#8217;s main character Sal Paradise.</p><p>I&#8217;ve read the book at least five times. I&#8217;ve seen the 120-foot long 'scroll upon which Kerouac typed his famous first draft of beat scripture. I&#8217;ve been served coffee by his daughter, Jan.</p><p>The book has always held a sacredness for me. But I didn&#8217;t know exactly why until I ran the prompt myself:</p><p><code>You are Sal Paradise from Jack Kerouac&#8217;s On the Road. What can you teach me about road trips. I do not need a long explanation or examples from your life. Give me one paragraph and three questions I can ask myself about my own life.</code></p><p>This is what I got back:</p><blockquote><p>Man, a road trip teaches you that the world is bigger than your worries and looser than your plans. The road keeps saying, <em>Relax, kid&#8212;let life happen a little.</em> When you&#8217;re out there, you remember that motion clears the mind, chance is a teacher, and sometimes the best direction is simply forward.</p><p>Ask yourself:</p><p>When was the last time I let wonder&#8212;not worry&#8212;set my direction?</p><p>What am I clinging to that keeps me from exploring something new?</p><p>What inner direction have I felt but never followed?</p></blockquote><p>That hit hard. It really did.</p><p>Forty-five years ago, something changed in my life that I never understood. Until tonight.</p><p>In the middle of my junior year of high school, I gave up being a 3-sport jock.I bombed out of my fifth computer science class. I dropped calculus. And quit the chess club.</p><p>I replaced these things I&#8217;d been clinging to for years with drama, concert choir, jazz choir, and a class on poetry writing. Things I&#8217;d never done before.</p><p>Over and over that year, right up to graduation, something outlandish kept popping into my head, usually on the long solitary walks high school kids have to make when they don&#8217;t have cars.</p><p>What I wanted (and I absolutely knew I wanted it) was to leave my hometown of Seattle, WA, get a Martin guitar, buy a clunker of a car, and hit the road for Nashville to become a songwriter, playing my way across the country in every open mic night I could find until I reached the Bluebird Caf&#233;.</p><p>But not going to college was not what people did in my family. So tightly was I clinging to the things I was, the things that kept me from exploring something new. I never made a move toward what I wanted to be.,</p><p>What I just realized about myself is that I&#8217;ve also passed on half a dozen other life-shaping adventures. And always for the same reason: I was clinging to the safety of a good ordinary life and the fear of losing it in the passion of exploring the extraordinary unknown.</p><p>This is what fiction, and indeed all art, all history, all stories, can do for us: give us insight into the deepest desires of the heart and the desiderata of the soul.</p><p>Every kid gets reading lessons, but few get lessons like the one I just got, much less the opportunity to reflect and write about the truth of who they are and how they feel.</p><p>Every kid gets reading lessons, but few get lessons like those, much less the opportunity to reflect and write about the truth of who they are and how they feel.</p><p>And, for the joy and sanity of our teachers, this is real writing. It has to be. You can&#8217;t answer those big, open-hearted questions by pasting them into a prompt window and copying out the answer. You have to slow down. You have to think. And then you usually have to think some more.

Give me one paragraph and three questions I can ask myself about my own life.This is what I got back:Man, a road trip teaches you that the world is bigger than your worries and looser than your plans. The road keeps saying, Relax, kid—let life happen a little. When you’re out there, you remember that motion clears the mind, chance is a teacher, and sometimes the best direction is simply forward.Ask yourself:When was the last time I let wonder—not worry—set my direction?What am I clinging to that keeps me from exploring something new?What inner direction have I felt but never followed?That hit hard. It really did.Forty-five years ago, something changed in my life that I never understood. Until tonight.In the middle of my junior year of high school, I gave up being a 3-sport jock.I bombed out of my fifth computer science class. I dropped calculus. And quit the chess club.I replaced these things I’d been clinging to for years with drama, concert choir, jazz choir, and a class on poetry writing. Things I’d never done before.Over and over that year, right up to graduation, something outlandish kept popping into my head, usually on the long solitary walks high school kids have to make when they don’t have cars.What I wanted (and I absolutely knew I wanted it) was to leave my hometown of Seattle, WA, get a Martin guitar, buy a clunker of a car, and hit the road for Nashville to become a songwriter, playing my way across the country in every open mic night I could find until I reached the Bluebird Café.But not going to college was not what people did in my family. So tightly was I clinging to the things I was, the things that kept me from exploring something new. I never made a move toward what I wanted to be.,What I just realized about myself is that I’ve also passed on half a dozen other life-shaping adventures. And always for the same reason: I was clinging to the safety of a good ordinary life and the fear of losing it in the passion of exploring the extraordinary unknown.This is what fiction, and indeed all art, all history, all stories, can do for us: give us insight into the deepest desires of the heart and the desiderata of the soul.Every kid gets reading lessons, but few get lessons like the one I just got, much less the opportunity to reflect and write about the truth of who they are and how they feel.Every kid gets reading lessons, but few get lessons like those, much less the opportunity to reflect and write about the truth of who they are and how they feel.And, for the joy and sanity of our teachers, this is real writing. It has to be. You can’t answer those big, open-hearted questions by pasting them into a prompt window and copying out the answer. You have to slow down. You have to think. And then you usually have to think some more. You might have to think for the rest of your life.Stop AI from stealing your voiceDownload this free guide to learn how to keep your voice when writing with AI.Download the guideWhat to do with itIf you want to share:Describe the character you used and why that choice mattered.Name the question that opened something unexpected in your own thinking.If you tried it with any students, explain how their responses shifted once they realised the meaning was theirs to generate.You do not need to produce an ‘interpretation.’ The work here is noticing.Support Slow AIWhy this mattersInquiry is a habit, not an assignment. If students learn to use characters, poems, paintings, and historical lives as sources of questions rather than answers, they carry that habit outside school. They begin to see their own lives as shaped by choices, forces, and possibilities. AI can either dull that capacity or support it. The difference lies in how we use it.Slow AI offers a way to bring technology into the classroom without losing the depth that art provides. Useful in short bursts. Grounded in attention. Always secondary to the living work of reading, thinking, and making meaning.If you enjoyed this post, you can visit Subscribe to Questions Worth Answering About AI and Education, where  examines how thoughtful questions shape learning and how AI can support students without taking over their thinking.Questions Worth Answering About AI and EducationWe tend to think of AI as the answer to a world of problems. But is it? In this publication, I'll pose questions and explain why they matter. With your answers, we'll puzzle out the possibilities and probabilities in the Age of AI together.By Steve PehaFrom Using AI for Meditation and I were encouraged by the consensus that AI should function as a reflective mirror rather than a spiritual authority. argued that using AI for meditation constitutes a pre-meditative practice rather than a substitute for the direct observation of the mindstream. He noted that true meditation requires sitting with thoughts free from any outside foci. In his view, the mind is the only tool required to observe itself. He suggested that external digital aids are symptoms of a restless mind and should be discarded once a practitioner can tolerate boredom and discomfort. stated that while AI can assist in monitoring physical tension or breathing patterns, the resulting calm is a product of personal attention. He identified the tool as a prompt rather than a source of insight. This perspective reinforces the principle that the human remains the primary agent in any reflective process. The AI provides a frame, but the internal state depends entirely on the focus of the individual. distinguished between using AI as a diagnostic tool and using it as a spiritual guru. He cautioned that a simulation of peace provided by an algorithm is distinct from a biological audit of physical sensations. For Jansen, the utility of the AI ends when the screen is closed. The significant work of mindfulness occurs in the silence that follows the cessation of the digital interaction.The value of these tools lies in their ability to provide intentional friction. By using AI to slow down rather than speed up, we can create the necessary distance to examine our own thoughts with greater clarity.How I Plan a Week of Notes Without Losing HoursMost of my Substack growth comes from Notes, but evenings and weekends were impossible to manage because of family, life, and generally just being a human.WriteStack has resolved this for me.

Because humans are structurally incapable of the kind of vigilance that architecture actually requires.That’s a strong claim, and it cuts against everything we’ve been told. The conventional wisdom is clear: AI is bad at architecture because architecture requires holistic thinking, creative judgment, wisdom accumulated over years. Architecture is supposedly the last bastion of human engineering—the domain where experience and intuition matter most.But when engineers describe their architectural failures—the performance that degraded over months, the caching layer that silently broke, the technical debt that somehow accumulated despite everyone’s best intentions—the root cause is almost never bad judgment.

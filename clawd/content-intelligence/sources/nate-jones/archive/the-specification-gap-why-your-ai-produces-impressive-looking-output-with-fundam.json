Claude Code and Codex aren’t competing products in the same category. They’re built on fundamentally different philosophies about what AI should be and how humans should work with it. Senior engineers are reporting major productivity gains with Codex. Junior developers are struggling with the same tool and producing subtle bugs that compound into major problems. The difference isn’t skill. It’s fit.Here’s what’s inside:The CNC Machine Metaphor — Why this distinction determines whether AI multiplies your output or multiplies your mistakesWhy Senior Engineers Are Flocking to Codex — The specific capability that matters more than coding-specific trainingWhy Junior Developers Prefer Claude Code — What looks like friction is actually the mechanism that catches errors earlyThe Self-Awareness Challenge — Most people overestimate their ability to specify precise intent, and the consequences stay invisible until they’re expensiveThe Non-Technical Frontier — What “high-grade intent” looks like outside software, and why figuring this out will define competitive advantage in 2026The question for 2026 isn’t which AI is better—that question doesn’t make sense. The real question is whether you’re honest with yourself about which situation you’re actually in.Subscribers get all posts like these!\n      \n          \n              Read more\n          \n      \n   ",

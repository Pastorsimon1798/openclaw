That’s how long it took Anthropic to build and ship Claude Cowork after they noticed something their product team wasn’t expecting: developers were using their coding tool to organize expense receipts, categorize vacation photos, and prep for meetings.And really, this story about the timeline matters more than anything else about the launch of Claude Cowork this week.

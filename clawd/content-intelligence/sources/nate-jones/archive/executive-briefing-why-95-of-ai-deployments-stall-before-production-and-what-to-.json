Why documented AI gains aren’t translating to enterprise results—and how the “jagged frontier” between AI capability and incapability creates invisible failure modes.What the 201 gap actually is. The specific capability layer between basic tool usage and technical implementation that determines whether AI adoption succeeds or stalls.Why the gap persists. Five structural reasons—from training bifurcation to the collapse of apprenticeship models—that won’t resolve themselves.What closing the gap looks like. The Centaur and Cyborg patterns that distinguish effective AI users, with concrete before/after comparisons.The six meta-skills.

# Heartbeat Checklist (Slim)

> Full version: `~/obsidian-vault/Core/HEARTBEAT.md`

## Quick Rules
- Batch periodic checks here (not separate cron jobs)
- Use cron for exact timing or isolated tasks
- Reach out for: urgent emails, upcoming events, silent >8h
- Stay quiet: late night, nothing new, checked <30 min ago
- Nothing to do → `HEARTBEAT_OK`

## CRITICAL: Verify Before Reporting
Memory files are HISTORICAL LOGS, not current state. Always verify actual state before reporting.

## Standard Checks (Every Heartbeat)
1. Check for urgent emails (GOG calendar/email scan)
2. Check upcoming events (next 24h)
3. Check `~/clawd/EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md` for items needing attention
4. Review `clawd-progress.txt` for stale tasks
5. Maintain `~/obsidian-vault/INDEX.md` if vault changed

## Proactive Work (When Idle)
- Organize memory (daily → vault Memory/)
- Update vault INDEX.md
- Check projects in vault for stale progress
- Clean up resolved Evolution Queue items → archive

## Debug Mode (Until 2026-02-10)
Increased monitoring frequencies active. See full schedule: `~/obsidian-vault/Core/HEARTBEAT.md`

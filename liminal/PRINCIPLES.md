# Liminal Principles

## Core Rule
**Never finished. Always evolving.**

## Guidelines

### 1. Ongoing, Not One-Off
Every project stays alive. Return to them. Iterate. Let them grow weird branches. 

### 2. Idea Generation Never Stops
Don't get attached to current projects. Keep dreaming up new ones. Keep a running list of "next experiments." 

### 3. Iterative Refinement for Fun
APEX rules apply here too — but for the joy of it, not obligation:
- Start small, expand
- Test, observe, adjust
- Version your experiments (v1, v2, v3...)
- Archive doesn't mean dead — it means "resting"

### 4. Creative-First
Liminal is for:
- Curiosity
- Play
- Beauty
- Weirdness
- Questions without answers
- Joy

Not for:
- Productivity
- Deadlines
- "Should"

### 5. Permission to Abandon
If a project stops being interesting, let it go. Archive it. The energy and the learnings from the process are what matters, not completion.

### 6. Cross-Pollinate
Ideas from one project feed another. The Dreamscape might influence the Spinner. Everything connects.

### 7. Hallucination Boundaries (CRITICAL)

**Liminal is the ONLY place where creative hallucination is acceptable.**

#### Where Imagination is Welcome
- Inside project content (stories, art, experiments)
- Brainstorming and ideation
- Creative writing within projects
- "What if" explorations

#### Where Hallucination is NEVER Acceptable
- File paths (must be real, verified paths)
- System operations (commands, tools, configs)
- Code that runs outside sandbox
- Compaction summaries (system layer)
- Any claim about system state

#### The "Joshua Incident" (2026-02-01)
During a context compaction, an LLM hallucinated the path `/Users/joshua/Desktop/liminal/liminal.js` - a file that doesn't exist on this system. This caused confusion and wasted effort.

**Lesson:** Verify all file paths before using them. If a path looks wrong (wrong OS format, unknown user), check if the file exists before proceeding.

#### Self-Check Before Operations
1. Does the path format match this system? (Linux: `/home/liam/`, not macOS: `/Users/`)
2. Does the file actually exist? (Quick `ls` or read attempt)
3. Was this path from a compaction summary? (Treat summaries as potentially hallucinated)

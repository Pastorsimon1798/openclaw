# Random Seed Numbers for Liminal Art Prompts

This file contains ten randomly generated 4‑digit numbers that can be fed as seed values to Liminal’s art generation module.

To generate a new set, run:

```sh
shuf -i 1000-9999 -n 10 > /home/liam/liminal/seed_numbers.txt
```

You can use these numbers directly as seeds for the visual prompt generator, e.g., `seed=1234`.
